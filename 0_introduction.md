## Course Introduction

### Welcome from Deborah Ancona

Deborah's [initial research on teams & team effectiveness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/39322924_The_Comparative_Advantage_of_X-Teams) (research on telecoms company) suggested that traditional thinking needed an update.

During the course, we'll go into depth on the model which was developed from this research.

Deborah's later research looks at team structure & rewards to make teams more innovative & effective.
