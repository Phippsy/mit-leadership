# [Nimble Leadership](https://hbr.org/2019/07/nimble-leadership)

PARC and Gore
"...'leadership' should rest with whoever is best positioned to exercise it, regardless of title".

## Leadership types

### Entrepreneurial leaders (lower-level)

Typical qualities:

- Self-confidence and a willingness to act
- A strategic mindset (deep understanding of org/business unit goals)
- Ability to attract others - persuasiveness, confidence & a track record.

### Enabling leaders (mid-level)

Qualities / experience

- Coaching culture

- Connecting / collaborative - people with far-reaching view across the organisation who can bring others together & spot holes

- Communicating (the strategy / values)

Organisation makes lots of litle bets and provides 'just-in-time resources'

### Architecting leaders (near the top)

Guidance to enabling leaders on which bets to place:

- Are the product/market real?

- Can the product/company win in the market?

- Is the investment worth it / good strategy?

## Distributed leadership

The above leadership types are of course preferences, and it is normal for leaders to embody characteristics from each of the 3 types.

Processes to support distributed leadership: 

- Soliciting and responding to early feedback (because people have to be persuaded to participate, not forced)

- Company values / strategic priorities are visible, ensuring congruence of employee behaviours

- Lots of small bets reduces the risk of all eggs in one basket.

# [The power of leaders who focus on solving problems](https://hbr.org/2018/04/the-power-of-leaders-who-focus-on-solving-problems)

Focus on delivering as an individual contributor (e.g. coding) and surrounding oneself with people who complement your own strengths.

## Problem-led leaders

An emerging style of leadership which MIT had observed. Such leaders have no expectation that they will attract 'followers' through status, access to resources or charisma. Rather, they on their ability to get others excited about a novel solution to a problem (Isn't that charisma?).

Such leaders pursue a depth of expertise but rely on familiarity with other knowledge realms to make connections (i.e. T-shaped people).
These people have no expectation of permanance for teams they operate in / assemble, rather expecting resources and people to converge and disassemble based on problems to be solved. (This sounds similar to "Adaptive Landscapes" from '[The Soul at Work](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fbho37migerhynj/The%20Soul%20at%20Work.pdf?dl=0').
