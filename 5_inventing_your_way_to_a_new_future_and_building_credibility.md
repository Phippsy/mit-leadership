# Inventing, its sub-dimensions, and building credibility

## What is inventing?

Creating the structures and processes to transform a vision into reality. It is particularly important to be able to invent in our exponentially changing world, since old ways of working may no longer be effective.

# The sub-dimensions of inventing

## 1) Execution

"Making sure that the trains are running on time.".

### Ambidexterity

This is the ability of organisations to deliver business results and innovate at the same time (O’Reilly and Tushman 2004).

- Incremental innovations: small improvements to existing products or services.
- Architectural innovations: Fundamentally altering a component of the organisation through technology or process.
- Discontinuous innovation: Radical advances which profoundly affect the whole industry.

O'Reilly and Tushman observe that the rate of organisational failure is increasing in recent times. One of the root causes of this failure is that organisations build structures and processes based on prior success. When faced with technological discontinuity, this old operating recipe no longer applies. Leaders must maintain a balance between delivering on successful recipes and continued sensemaking to observe important changes.

Explore-Exploit is the combination of sensemaking to identify opportunities / challenges and invent organisational capabilities to profit from the observed situation.

#### Advice for ambidexterity

Implement organisational roles which include execution and innovation, then build a team which can deal with **inconsistency and tension**. Be proud of tension, do not flee from it. Dr. Ancona comments that this necessitates an organisational culture + coaching where people feel able to speak up and lean into this inconsitency and tension. 

## 2) Creating a learning culture

People should feel safe and free from blame. "How can we learn to do this differently? How can we encourage experimentation?".

## 3) Making touch decisions

This involves prioritising competing demands while assessing the viability of a given course of action. You must continue to make decisions as you move ahead with innovation - avoid getting bogged down by the sheer number of decisions.

## 4 Managing change

This includes bringing people along and having a plan for change.

# Incorporating inventing into your leadership approach

Guidelines:

- Don't assume that the established way of doing things is best.
- Constantly look for alternative methods of operating.
- Devise creative responses to challenges / opportunities and encourage others to do the same.
- Determine whether other options are available, brainstorm new ones if others don't exist
- Create an environment in which everyone believes creating solutions to new and existing problems is part of their job.

# Building Credibility

This is the + in 4-CAPS+. Unlike the other 4 capabilities, it is essential for leadership.

## Leading with integrity

Consistency: Do you do what you say you're going to do? Do you follow-through on your commitments to others? Are you the same person across contexts? 

## Leading with shared purpose

Lead everybody together towards what you have promised. There is a rise right now in toxic leadership: those who care only about themselves. Ego-centric, power hungry, crappy leadership. 
Focus on what we all can do together.


# Activity

Polls

1) A management model focused on constructive feedback.

This was hard to select, but I believe cultural change relies on leadership setting an example. I almost chose "a meeting agenda item that celebrates employee innovation", but chose this because it suggests a more positive communication style from management and (hopefully) less formality.

I would not choose "a customer-centric innovation strategy that provides purpose" for this particular problem. Whilst I can see value in doing this, I don't perceive that it addresses the 5 bullet points listed, which are more related to internal operations in my opinion.

2) Aligning the transformation with Microsoft's other goals

Assuming Microsoft's other goals are fit for long-term purpose, they will be a useful litmus test of the validity of any new inventions. Personally I don't see much validity in any of these 4 options. I would prefer a blended monitoring of employee satisfaction, business performance and # of new customers onboarded or new product experiments conducted. This would help track the ambidextrous performance of the company and the state of the company culture.

3) Diversifying the employee base to bring in more perspectives

It has been demonstrated that workplace diversification results in a greater volume of new ideas and innovative thinking. I would expect a result of this change to be that employees were subjected to challenging thinking and incentivised to assess and update their own views of the world. A learning culture would fit naturally with this new organisational behaviour.

4) Ensuring the change infiltrates the entire organisation

One of the hardest aspects of organisational change, in my opinion, is bridging the gap between the vision of change and the successful implementation and adoption of these ideas by employees who may be less motivated than (e.g.) senior management teams to change their behaviours. Ensuring that change infiltrates the entire organisation would be the most effective means of securing maximum impact for this change, in my opinion.

I would not choose "Constantly and openly communicating about the change process" because this option does not mention tracking the effectiveness of communication. Communication without a feedback loop can be damaging, and I think it is important to include this.

5) Actively taking part in the changes you are instituting

This is a critical part of "leading with integrity" - showing behaviour consistent with the expectations you have for others.

# Casebook: How leaders approach inventing and building credibility

## Andy Plump

Initial progress was slow - Dr. Plump describes that there was "dead weight" in the organisation - people who were there just to survive, rather than help to build the future of the company.

Tough decisions: getting rid of dead weight. 60% of the employee base was turned over. One of the reasons this transition took so long is because severance packages were "quite nice" and Takeda offered a fund to anyone who wanted to start their own businesse0s.

As part of the change, Takeda made the decision to move away from focusing on cardiovascular therapies. This was an area of strength for Dr. Plump, so communicating this change sent a statement to the rest of the organisation and helped with his credibility.

Furthermore, Dr. Plump was always "honest and direct", and he felt that the team always delivered on their promises.

## Michael Sorrell

The team at Paul Quinn College defined themselves in orientation towards their strengths, rather than competing in a space which they couldn't own. They were small & nimble, and good at solving problems. 

They identified the urgent need to address the economical performance of the institution. The team outsourced non-core competencies. Many functions were outsourced, since the team couldn't attract competitive talent, so they used the strength of commercial contracts to hold partners to standards.

They also decided to cut the football program, which was a significant cost and was not making money for the colleage. 

Dr. Sorrell then found new funding sources, and agreed to install a community garden in the place of the football field.

## Kristina Allikmets

Dr. Allikmet's invention was to request a dedicated team, rather than shared resources. 

Building credibility: transparency, being completely open about the team's purpose, and getting everybody's opinions on the board. 

Dr. Allikmets feels that it is important to show her commitment to the final, overarching purpose of the team. She follows through on that commitment, despite the changing environment within which the team operates.

## Maeve Coburn

Pick 1 thing, go back to your team, check in on how you're doing. The team implemented organisational surveys, but also leader surveys (which are linked to leader bonuses). 

The methods used to build strategic frameworks and structure team meetings were formalised around a common process. They defined "what does effective look like" and gave instruction to other leaders on how to operate.

L'Oreal created a community of champions who monitored whether this new, good practice was being adopted and provided feedback to leaders. They also reported up to the board.

Through admitting fault publicly and admitting that point to another employee, the CEO build credibility and earned the respect of the organisation.

The top leadership team - the "strategic committee" meets once a month to review progress. The progress has been at the top of every leadership agenda for a long period, which is a strong indication of its importance to the organisation.
