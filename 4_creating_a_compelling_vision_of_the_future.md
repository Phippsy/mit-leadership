# Visioning and its sub-dimensions

## What is visioning?

Creating a map of the potential future - painting a compelling picture of what could be, creating a catalyst for change. For this to happen, others must understand why the vision is necessary and what they can do to help achieve it.

## The sub-dimensions of visioning

### 1) Framing the vision

This is a way to provide meaning to the work which everyone is doing, which is crucial to their motivation.

Dr. Ancona recounts the story of the 3 masons - the third of whom sees that they are "building a cathedral" and therefore working the hardest of the three.

"[I'm not mopping the floors, I'm putting a man on the moon](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/what-leaders-can-learn-from-nasa/)"

Steve Jobs framed that "we are working to change the world", rather than just building a computer.

What is your frame? What is important about what people are doing? If it's not important, why do it?

Visioning is the capability which is most connected to changing peoples' state. How much others perceive your own belief and confidence in the vision will have an effect on their own excitement.

#### Using storytelling to frame a vision.

Stories have a relaxing effect, invoking emotions and encouraging the listener to use their imagination. This in turn increases others' receptivity to your ideas.

Tips:

- Use metaphors and imagery to explain what you want to accomplish.

- Invite people to imagine the future with you.

- Use sensory language

- Tap into and convey your own genuine emotions

Feelings such as solidarity, hope, urgency and self-confidence are positive forces for change.

THINKING POINT: What about when it is "My vision Vs your vision"?

THINKING POINT: Negative feedback loop of where we are now vs where I can see us being - perceived lack of progress. How to overcome?

### 2) Creating urgency for change

Visioning is about being in "arrow time" - it is urgent now. We have to get moving, even if we don't get there by tomorrow.

According to Dr. Marshall Ganz, it is helpful to focus on the following topics:

- Why is change necessary now? 

- What are the consequences if it does not occur?

- What are the benefits?

### 3) Building a shared vision

This is something which everybody can see themselves in. They can get excited about it, and want to help make this future happen. Instead of mandating action, you have to incite it.


## Incorporating visioning into your leadership approach

This will help you to successfully communicate your vision, highlight the need to act now and get others to help you make it happen.

Good general practice can include:

- Create a vision in all areas of your life

- Focuson what excites you

- Do not assume everyone else will immediately share your vision

- Avoid the urge to force others to be enthusiastic. Collaborate with others and modify the vision until there is shared support.

- Don't feel you need a clear plan before sharing with others - they can help you to create this.

- Use images, metaphors and stories.
