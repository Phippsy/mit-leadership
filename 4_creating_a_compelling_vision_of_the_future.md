# Visioning and its sub-dimensions

## What is visioning?

Creating a map of the potential future - painting a compelling picture of what could be, creating a catalyst for change. For this to happen, others must understand why the vision is necessary and what they can do to help achieve it.

## The sub-dimensions of visioning

### 1) Framing the vision

This is a way to provide meaning to the work which everyone is doing, which is crucial to their motivation.

Dr. Ancona recounts the story of the 3 masons - the third of whom sees that they are "building a cathedral" and therefore working the hardest of the three.

The hard part is forming connections between the 'lofty vision' and what employees are doing at ground level.
Have a single overarching goal which everyone can roll up to.
Have sub-goals (a la Kennedy) - use these to let people focus more attention / effort on ultimate goal. Use these to keep people focused on ultimate achievement. Sub-goals should pave the path to the vision, rather than breaking it into components.

Transform the abstract sub-goal into a concrete, tangible thing. Kennedy would mix abstract concepts with the physical world, e.g. "We want to go to the moon because knowledge and peace are there.". This creates a vivid image which people can mentally anchor to.

Steve Jobs framed that "we are working to change the world", rather than just building a computer.

What is your frame? What is important about what people are doing? If it's not important, why do it?

Visioning is the capability which is most connected to changing peoples' state. How much others perceive your own belief and confidence in the vision will have an effect on their own excitement.

#### Using storytelling to frame a vision.

Stories have a relaxing effect, invoking emotions and encouraging the listener to use their imagination. This in turn increases others' receptivity to your ideas.

Tips:

- Use metaphors and imagery to explain what you want to accomplish.

- Invite people to imagine the future with you.

- Use sensory language

- Tap into and convey your own genuine emotions

Feelings such as solidarity, hope, urgency and self-confidence are positive forces for change.

THINKING POINT: What about when it is "My vision Vs your vision"?

THINKING POINT: Negative feedback loop of where we are now vs where I can see us being - perceived lack of progress. How to overcome?

### 2) Creating urgency for change

Visioning is about being in "arrow time" - it is urgent now. We have to get moving, even if we don't get there by tomorrow.

According to Dr. Marshall Ganz, it is helpful to focus on the following topics:

- Why is change necessary now? 

- What are the consequences if it does not occur?

- What are the benefits?

### 3) Building a shared vision

This is something which everybody can see themselves in. They can get excited about it, and want to help make this future happen. Instead of mandating action, you have to incite it.


## Incorporating visioning into your leadership approach

This will help you to successfully communicate your vision, highlight the need to act now and get others to help you make it happen.

Good general practice can include:

- Create a vision in all areas of your life

- Focus on what excites you

- Do not assume everyone else will immediately share your vision

- Avoid the urge to force others to be enthusiastic. Collaborate with others and modify the vision until there is shared support.

- Don't feel you need a clear plan before sharing with others - they can help you to create this.

- Use images, metaphors and stories.

# Casebook: How leaders approach visioning

## Dr. Andy Plump

The most important thing which Andy Plump identified was **focus**. There was a proliferation of ideas in the organisation, but a core strategic framework was lacking. Dr. Plump also felt that there was a disconnect to what was happening in the outside world.

Takeda were also very technology-focused.

Dr. Plump realised that the company had stopped challenging themselves in terms of what they were doing - how far they were reaching. Innovation had dried up, and they were falling back on tried & tested formulas.

The case for change was objectively absolute: company performance (very poor) made it clear. The company "wasn't going anywhere". Dr. Plump was able to articulate the nightmare scenario as a means of motivating others, although he suggests that the company were previously unaware of this.

Different operating modes were tested out (similar to 'integrated learning loops.')

## Dr. Kristina Allikmets

The team united around a theme of challenging convention, doing things differently and finding a new way. They "aspire to inspire bold drug developments, because patients are waiting.".

Putting the patient front and centre in the development process became a key. Having the patient as a **partner** in developing the drug.

## Maeve Coburn

What Maeve Coburn observed was that when she began communicating this new approach, her colleagues realised that they couldn't cascade this information to their teams (i.e. 'push/brodcast') - rather, they had to campaign and incite the organisation to participate and get involved and create space for them to have a voice and co-create the future.

They used partners to create strategic framing - aligning people across the business on the key strategic priorities of the company.

Having and demonstrating confidence in others that they could own and influence the change was one way in which Maeve Coburn was able to bring people together behind a shared vision.

# Peer review activity

- Think about an outcome that you would like to achieve and how you could communicate the vision for that outcome. 
- Use the built-in webcam software on your PC, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone to record a video in which you inspire your peers to share in your vision. 
- Your vision can be related to any domain you are passionate about. Keep in mind that you need to motivate your peers with your vision for the future.
- Use the knowledge you have acquired in this module about effectively communicating a vision.
- Employ the sub-dimensions of visioning in your approach.
- Your video should be no longer than 3 minutes.
- Your video should not exceed 5GB.
- Your submission should consist only of a video. There is no need for a written response.
