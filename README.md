# MIT Leadership notes

This repo contains my notes from the MIT Sloan Leadership course.

## Summary of key learnings to date


## Actions I'll be taking

- Draft up a [Manager README](https://managerreadme.com/) as I think this supports the objectives of clarity and openness regarding my leadership signature.
- Reflect on the comments from Maeve Coburn about the Gestalt theory of change, the power of being fully present. Consider other behaviours (e.g. yoga, mindfulness practice) which complement this, and other practice I might consider.
