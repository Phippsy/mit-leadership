# Your leadership signature

## Learning outcomes

- LO1: Recognize the value of clarifying your leadership signature in a world that is changing exponentially.
- LO2: Demonstrate insight into leadership signatures by exploring leadership stories.

To thrive in today's fast-paced and complex business landscapes, businesses should consider moving from "command-and-control" leadership to "collaborate and learn".
This lesson explores this changing world and how you can benefit as a leader by exploring your leadership signature.

## 1.1 Thriving as a leader in an exponentially changing world

In the recent past, the world has been typified as VUCA: Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous. Today, the pace of change is accelerating at an even greater pace.

The questions for us to reflect on throughout this program are 

**How do you as a leader help people to:**

- Feel less stress / anxiety

- Engage in leadership

**How do you feel, how do you think others feel in these circumstances? What does this mean for leadership, moving ahead?**

Some examples of the forces of change include:

- Global population - there are 8 billion people on the planet, with waning resources.

- The effects of climate change

- Omnipresent technology, including

	- The internet: >1M new internet users per day.

	- A pervasive, high-volume of information in our daily lives

- New job types are being created - the average person changes jobs 12 times in their career.

## Clarifying your leadership signature

What differentiates you as a leader?

This is based on your values, personality, experiences and strengths.

Why is this important?

- People feel chaos and are nervous & scared about living in a world which seems out of control. As a leader, you can provide stability by communicating your signature. 

- You're providing cues to help people understand how they should interact with you.

- You're signalling what's important

Your leadership signature will continuously evolve.

### Case studies

#### Dr. Andy Plump

**What defines you as a leader?**

A combination of natural characteristics and learned behaviours.

For Dr. Plump:

- Authenticity

- Curiosity - a great way of showing interest in and engaging with people

#### Dr. Michael Sorrell

Dr. Sorrell was instrumental in turning around the fortunes of Paul Quinn, a colleage in Dallas, Texas.

He sees his leadership signature as focusing on kindness - empathising with others' situation and sacrificing his own gains for the greater good.

He created a set of values at Paul Quinn, spending a lot of time reflecting on how to build something authentic ("I can't sell what I don't believe.")

He believes in leaving things better than they were found, living a life that matters & loving something greater than oneself, choosing a harder right over the easier wrong.

#### Dr. Kristina Allikmets

Dr. Allikmets sees herself as **inclusive**, transparent and open.

She tries to create a safe environment where people feel open to propose ideas, including crazy ones.

The spin-in team: a non-standard, innovation-focused internal team tasked with setting the strategic direction for a molecule which didn't have an obvious natural home within the Takeda portfolio.

#### Maeve Coburn

Maeve Coburn's career pivoted significantly when she moved from a chemicl engineering track into marketing, management and learning.

L'Oreal recognised the influence of disruptive market conditions (inc. technology, social media, lower barriers to entry) on their business success.

Within this landscape of technology and data, Maeve Coburn hints at the importance of influencing organisational and individual behaviours for success.

Questions - leaving room for information, drilling down, becoming observant, being full present and aware, slowing down. Being attuned to what is.

"...it's the Gestalt theory of change - that change can only happen when you're fully aware of what's happening now in the room. And I've become much more aware of the power of being fully present, and aware, and naming what's in the room."

### Communicating a leadership signature

Remember that your actions and attitude reveal your leadership signature. Think about the signals you're sending. 
(Reminds me of Emerson "Who you are speaks so loudly I can't hear what you are saying!")

#### Satya Nadella's 10 rules for success

1. Be a lifelong learner, and apply the learning.

Course materials say "By engaging with a short segment of Satya Nadellaâ€™s leadership story, you can already appreciate how quickly a leadership signature can be communicated." 
I disagree - we are being explicitly **told** by Mr. Nadella that these are things he values, but I don't see any evidence (e.g. illustrative stories / case studies) of actions he has taken and their resulting impact.

#### Eileen Fisher

Premise: how does one survive in an industry (fashion) with a reputation as being cut-throat?

Eileen Fisher sees herself as helping women solve problems, not being a member of an industry. 
(This reminds me a little of the '[jobs to be done](http://jobstobedone.org/)' mindset).

Within these turbulent times, we need to be able to stay anchored, mindful. This is important for maintaining a sense of direction but also for one's mental well-being and effectiveness.

## Conclusion

An awareness of your leadership signature will help you identify your weaknesses and build a team which addresses them.

It seems likely to me that good leadership and good living / a healthy, fulfilling personal life go hand in hand. I wonder where the overlaps are, and where there are differences.

Know who you are, and own it.
